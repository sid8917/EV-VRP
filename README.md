# EV-VRP
The VRP is an important problem in logistics and transportation, with applications in areas such as delivery routing, waste collection, and school bus routing.

Genetic Algorithms for solving the travelling salesman problem and the vehicle routing problem (TSP, VRP) This practical assignment requires to develop, using Python, an implementation of genetic algorithms for solving the Travelling Salesman Problem -- TSP and the Vehicle Routing Problem -- VRP (at least should include TSP)

Travelling Salesman Problem. Find the optimum itinerary for a salesman that needs to visit a set of cities, visiting each city exactly once, except the city where the trip started, that must be the last city to visit. Vehicle Routing Problem. Find routes for shipping supplies to a set of customers having different demands. The routes should be adjusted to the available fleet of trucks in order to get minimum costs.
